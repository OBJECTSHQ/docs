> Build user friendly physical design apps with OBJECTS

## Introduction \[OBJECTS is an open protocol & network for developing physical design apps]

### Key Features

* **Permissionless Development**: Developers can build design & manufacturing apps for the network of users without needing centralized approval.
* **Portable Account**: Users own their identity and design data that can be seamlessly transferred to other apps.
* **Interoperable CAD Data**: Users can access their design data in the file format native to the apps built with the protocol.
* **Secure & Private**: All user data and communications are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring complete privacy and security.
* **Network**

### Architecture

* **Content Addressability**: Data is stored and retrieved using unique content addresses, ensuring data integrity.
* **Peer-to-Peer Protocols**: Direct communication between peers enhances efficiency and reduces reliance on central servers.

### Use Cases

* **Collaborative Design**: Multiple users can work on the same CAD project in real-time.
* **Data Integrity**: Ensures that CAD data remains unchanged and verifiable across its lifecycle.

## Overview

P2P network based on gossipsub that creates an identity and associates 3D CAD data to it.

### Application Layer

### Data Layer

#### Content-Addressed Data

Content-addressed data ensures data integrity, immutability, scalability, and resiliency. Only the content hash of 3D files and metadata is stored on the protocol, not the 3D data itself.

#### Security Properties

### Network Layer

#### Consensus

### Storage Layer

#### Indexing
