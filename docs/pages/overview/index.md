# Introduction [OBJECTS is an open protocol & network for developing physical design apps]

## Core Principles

- **Local-first**: Data is stored locally and synced peer-to-peer. Apps work offline by default with no central server dependency.
- **Mobile-friendly**: Built on QUIC for reliable connectivity across network transitions and intermittent connections.
- **User-owned**: One login, all your data. Switch apps instantly with a single account. Your projects follow you everywhere.
- **Privacy-first**: Users control who accesses their data. Apps require explicit permission to read or sync your projects.
- **Peer-to-peer**: Direct device-to-device communication. No intermediary required for data access or sync. (Initial nodes will be operated by OBJECTS Foundation)

## Key Features

- **Portable Identity**: Passkey-based identity that works across all apps built on the protocol.
- **Interoperable Data**: Shared data model allows apps to read and write the same design files.
- **End-to-end Encrypted**: All data and communications encrypted by default. Apps can only access your data with your explicit permission.
- **Permissionless**: Build and ship apps without platform approval or API keys. Launch with instant access to users who already have accounts and data. Skip user acquisition from scratch.

## Use Cases

- **Collaborative Design**: Real-time multi-user editing with automatic conflict resolution.
- **Offline-first Apps**: Full functionality without connectivity, sync when available.
- **Cross-app Workflows**: Users move designs between apps without export/import friction.
