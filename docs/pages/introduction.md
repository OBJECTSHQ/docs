# Introduction [OBJECTS is an open protocol & network for developing physical design apps]

## Key Features
- **Permissionless Development**: Developers can build design & manufacturing apps for the network of users without needing centralized approval.
- **Portable Account**: Users own their identity and design data that can be seamlessly transferred to other apps.
- **Interoperable CAD Data**: Users can access their design data in the file format native to the apps built with the protocol.
- **Secure & Private**: All user data and communications are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring complete privacy and security.
- **Network**

## Architecture
- **Content Addressability**: Data is stored and retrieved using unique content addresses, ensuring data integrity.
- **Peer-to-Peer Protocols**: Direct communication between peers enhances efficiency and reduces reliance on central servers.

## Use Cases
- **Collaborative Design**: Multiple users can work on the same CAD project in real-time.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that CAD data remains unchanged and verifiable across its lifecycle.
