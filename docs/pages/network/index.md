# Network

The OBJECTS network is built on a layered infrastructure designed for decentralized, peer-to-peer communication and data exchange. This section covers the core components that make up the network architecture.

## Layers

- [**Registry**](/network/registry) - Service for registering and looking up identities across the network
- [**Index**](/network/indexing) - Content indexing and lookup infrastructure
- [**Relay**](/network/relay) - Data relay for peer-to-peer communication
- [**Discovery**](/network/discovery) - Mechanisms for finding peers and content on the network
