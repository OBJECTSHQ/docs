# Protocol [OBJECTS protocol specification layers]

The OBJECTS protocol is organized into four layers, each handling a specific aspect of the system. Together, these layers provide a complete framework for building decentralized physical design applications.

## Specification Layers

- **[Identity](/protocol/identity)** - User-owned identities, handles, and authentication
- **[Data](/protocol/data)** - Asset schemas, operations, versioning, and history
- **[Sync](/protocol/sync)** - Mechanisms for synchronizing state between peers
- **[Transport](/protocol/transport)** - How data moves between nodes
