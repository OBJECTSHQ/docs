# Protocol [OBJECTS protocol specification layers]

The OBJECTS protocol is organized into six distinct layers, each handling a specific aspect of the system. Together, these layers provide a complete framework for building decentralized physical design applications.

## Specification Layers

- **[Identity](/protocol/identity)** - Defines how accounts and keys are managed
- **[Data Model](/protocol/data-model)** - Structures for representing physical design assets
- **[Operations](/protocol/operations)** - Actions that can be performed on assets
- **[History](/protocol/history)** - Directed acyclic graph for tracking changes over time
- **[Sync](/protocol/sync)** - Mechanisms for synchronizing state between peers
- **[Transport](/protocol/transport)** - How data moves between nodes
